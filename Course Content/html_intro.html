<!-- DOM conversations are going to be relevant down the line

HTML - hypertext markup language
Not a programming language
No logic without JS

-->

<!--
    Understanding overall structure:
    Every browser tab will have one HTML doc within it
    Every doc follows basic HTML structure
-->

<!--
    We are going to focus more on the body tag
-->


<!-- Note difference between element and tag

an element is one complete element while a tag is an indicator for the type of element we are creaitng
an element can have attributes 


normal tags have an openening and closing tag where you but something in the middke to create an element
e.g. <div>, <span>, <strong>

self closing tags - dont need to be closed and you cannot put any tags within them
<img /> , <input/>, <meta/>, <link/>

-->

<p class "some-class"> some text </p>
<img src = "https://www.motortrend.com/uploads/2022/08/2022-Bugatti-Chiron-Super-Sport-2-1.jpg?fit=around%7C875:492" width = "300">

<div> some text </div>  <!-- div tag is for a standard container and can be used to store more elements -->
