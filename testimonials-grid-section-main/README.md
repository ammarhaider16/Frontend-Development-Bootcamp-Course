## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved my skills of using flexbox to create layouts in HTML, and I also reinforced my responsive design skills.

### Continued development

I would continue improving my frontend development skills and create responsive design that can adapt to devices other than desktop and mobile. I would also use JavaScript development skills for future projects, as this project only required HTML and CSS.
